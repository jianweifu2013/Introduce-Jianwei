# Background

For the past four years, Jianwei has worked as a Data Analyst. His passionate spirit has lead him to skill in various *__Data Science__* solutions, just like Statistical Analysis, Time-Series Forecasting, Linear & Logistic Regression, Clustering, and more.

Now he wants to start another adventure in *__Data Science__* area, and would like to seek an advance analytical position which could help him transit from a skilled Data Analyst to a successful Data Scientist.

Through his undergraduate and graduate study in China, he built a solid understanding about business administration and finance. After graduating, his experience working in the bank allowed him to effectively implement what he learned from school. The combination of study and work forged his qualitative analyzing skills. His quantitative analyzing framework, along with data-driven and statistical-based approaches, were similarly built via his study at Fordham University, majoring in statistics and decision making and working as a data analyst. With his ambition, education, and previous working experience, he is confident about his qualification for the analytical position and to make contribution to companies/organizations.
